Welcome to Garden Tracker!

Garden Tracker is a simple way to keep track of gardens that you and other users create, including keeping track of the species and plantings within each garden.  

To use this app:

1. Clone it.

2. In your terminal, `cd` into the parent directory for Garden Tracker.  

3. In your terminal run: `rake db:migrate`

4. Also in your terminal, run: `rails s`.

5. Head to localhost:3000 in your browser.  Then you can create an account for yourself, add gardens, add species, and add plantings to your gardens.  

To close out the program, close your browser, and in the terminal where you ran `rails s`, hit control+c (on a Mac).  

To run the program again, repeat step 2 and then step 4.  

Thanks for stopping by!
