      # When creating a new garden and mass assignment jumps to this method,
      # the garden (parent of planting) has to be saved first or else there
      # will be an error when trying to create the associated planting in this method.
      # In other words, even though this is triggered by Garden.create, the garden
      # instance is not saved yet with an id, and so we need to save it here to create the
      # child planting:
      
    if self.save

        # Need to specify ".values" because, thanks to the has_nested_attributes_for
        # macro, the format looks like [plantings_attributes][0][hash_of_attributes].
        # So .values is used to run just the hash_of_attributes through the methods below:
      planting_attributes_hash.values.each do | planting_attributes |

          # First, check if we are creating a new garden and creating a new planting with it.
          # This will be the case if the user has filled in something for [:quantity]
          # and the planting does not have an [:id] yet because the planting has not been persisted:
        if planting_attributes[:quantity] != "" && !planting_attributes[:id]
          planting = self.plantings.build(planting_attributes)
          planting.save

          # Second, check if we are editing a planting.  This will be the case if the plantings
          # has an [:id] that was passed into params by rails (in an autogenerated hidden field):
        elsif planting_attributes[:id]
          planting = Planting.find_by(id: planting_attributes[:id])
          planting.update(planting_attributes)
          planting.save # Calling planting save to trigger error messages # did not appear to trigger error messages

        end
      end
    end
  end
    # binding.pry # The update function is not calling this!! #It's b/c I forgot that it's plantingS_attributes, not planting_attributes, when i custom wrote it.

    # This worked with #new in the full accepts_nested_attributes regime.
    # if self.save
    #   planting_attributes_hash.values.each do | planting_attributes |
    #     if planting_attributes[:quantity] != ""
    #       planting = self.plantings.build(planting_attributes)
